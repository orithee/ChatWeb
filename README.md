# ChatWeb

This project is my graduation project after half a year of Fullstack studies.
During the program, we briefly went over the 'WebSocket' technology.
I liked this technology and its capabilities, and so when we started to think about our final project I decided to take the challenge - develop a new web application that offers chat platform services without using cellular newtworks nor phone numbers. Of course, this is a big goal. But I'm moving forward step by step, learning a lot, and mostly having fun :)
